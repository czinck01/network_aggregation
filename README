Applying Network Aggregation Techniques to the DREAM Challenge Data.

Commands:
python aggregate.py - finds the scored aggregated clustering of a collection of
np matrices located in data/networks/DSDs, using node lists in data/nodelists,
gene_ids in data/ids/gene_ids.txt and parameters in src/params

python dsd.py - computes the DSD matrices and nodelists of a collection of
edgelists located in data/networks/anonymized

python convert.py - converts a directed graph to an undirected graph given a 
filename as a command line parameter

python stats.py - outputs a variety of statistics for the networks located in
data/networks/anonymized

*Note*
FuncAssociate cannot be pip installed and therefore must be installed manually.
It is also necessary to request a license from the creators of the software
before using it.
